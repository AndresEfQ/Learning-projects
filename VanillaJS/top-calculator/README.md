# TOP-calculator

This project is a web calculator based on The Odin Project foundations course requirements, the live preview is ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://andresefq.github.io/top-calculator/) ðŸ‘ˆ

## Project characteristics I'm proud of

* Float point.
* I think it looks nice.
* Backspace.
* It has keyboard support.
* The layout is stable because the max amount of digits on screen is fixed.
* Overflow is controlled.
* Buttons are deactivated to avoid error propagation.
* Every time the input changes, there is a brief refresh time in the screen which makes it feel like something actually happened.

## What I have learned

* To add and remove event listeners using forEach.
* Regular expressions.
* Javascript ternary operator.
* To use the same functions for various events using OR
* To remove focus from elements using blur()
