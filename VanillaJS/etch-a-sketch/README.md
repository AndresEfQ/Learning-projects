# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is a browser version of the Etch-A-Sketch toy, it's part of The Odin Project curriculum.

I must say that I felt in love with this project, I really liked adding new features and improving it's appearance.

The live preview is available in https://andresefq.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

## Instructions

- **Start Drawing:** In order to start drawing, you must click inside the drawing area to turn on the toy, the blue light in the right corner will turn on indicating you may start drawing. Click again to turn off the toy and stop drawing.

- **Change Size:** You may choose a grid size between 16 and 64 rows with the same number of cells per row. In order to change the grid size you just need to move the slider with the `Change Size` caption and the grid will be drawn automatically. The number below the slider indicates the number of rows and columns.

- **Choose Color:** You may choose a color to draw by clicking in the square with the `Color` caption. This option won't have any effect in the `Rainbow` and `Random` modes. The default color is black but you should try some different colors, or even draw with several different colors, it's beautiful.

- **Rainbow Mode:** You may select the Rainbow Mode by clicking in the button with the `Rainbow` caption. In this mode, the color will change following the rainbow pattern (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet) in every new cell. The selected color won't have any effect in this mode. When you select Rainbow Mode, the Soft and Random modes are automatically deselected, but the drawings made with these modes will stay, so you can combine modes to get some beautyful results.

- **Random Mode:** You may select the Random Mode by clicking in the button with the `Random` caption. In this mode, the color will change to a totally random color in every new cell. As it happened in the Rainbow Mode, the selected color won't have any affect in the Random Mode. Soft and Rainbow modes are also automatically deselected in the Random Mode but the drawings remain.

- **Soft Mode:** You may select the Soft Mode by clicking in the button with the `Soft` caption. In this mode, the color you chose will be applied little by little when you go over the cell multiple times, once you reach the original color, it will become darker and darker with each pass until it gets completely black. When Soft Mode is selected, the Rainbow and Random modes are automatically deselected, but the drawings remain, exactly the same that happened in the other modes.
