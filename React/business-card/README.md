# Buisiness Card

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is part of the Scrimba course from Bob Ziroll [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

The live versi√≥n is available [Here](https://andresefq.github.io/business-card/).

## What I have learned

* To divide the content in react components.
* To style individual components.
* To compose the App with all the individual components.
