# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was coded following the Intro to React tutorial from [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), it helped me get a first impression of how react apps are built.

## What I have learned

I learned how to work with React-

* Elements
* Components
* Props
* State
* setState

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
