    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="cont1">What a delicious memory! At home, the word ajiaco (potato and chicken stew) was always a accompanie by a party, friends, cousins and uncles coming over; and with lots, and lots of flavor. From the very first moment the pot was placed on the stove, the majestic aroma of the gallant soldier weeds, the indispensable ingredient needed to prepare a delicious Colombian Ajiaco, would fill the house. Ajiaco is one of the staples of traditional Colombian cuisine; it's also the famous weekend soup. However, it is customary to prepare large portions of this soup for family gatherings and different occasions. Here I invite you to delight yourself by making this delicious recipe. Enjoy it with your family!</p>
