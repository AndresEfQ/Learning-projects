    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="cont1">
      <p>Ask anyone from South America what their favorite soup from childhood is, and you will get sancocho as the answer. It varies widely from country to country and region to region, but everyone agrees it's a soup to warm your soul.
  
      <p>Colombian sancocho is a variation of soup made with meat, hearty vegetables, a traditional broth, corn, and herbs. The Colombians serve it with a side of rice, avocado, and a special hot sauce called aj√≠ picante. You can find seafood sancocho on the coast or a poultry sancocho in the mountains.</p>
        
      <p>Along with the famous ajiaco, sancocho is a traditional soup found in every Colombian family cookbook and another one of the country's favorite dishes.</p>
